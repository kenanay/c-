   Here are the descriptions for each main category in your C++ curriculum:

1. **Fundamentals**
The foundational building blocks of C++ programming, covering basic syntax, data structures, and core concepts necessary for writing simple programs. This section introduces the essential elements needed to start programming in C++.

2. **Control Flow**
Mechanisms for controlling program execution flow, including decision-making structures and various types of loops. These constructs allow programs to make decisions and repeat actions based on conditions.

3. **Functions**
Building blocks for modular programming that enable code reuse and organization. This section covers different ways to create and use functions, including modern features like lambda expressions.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming**
Core principles and implementation of object-oriented programming in C++, including the creation and management of classes, inheritance hierarchies, and polymorphic behavior.

5. **Memory Management**
Techniques and concepts for managing program memory effectively, including manual and automatic memory management, understanding memory allocation, and modern memory management practices.

6. **Templates**
Generic programming features that allow writing code that works with multiple data types. Templates provide type-safe generic programming capabilities and are fundamental to modern C++ programming.

7. **STL (Standard Template Library)**
A powerful collection of template classes and functions that provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates. The STL provides containers, algorithms, and iterators that form the backbone of many C++ applications.

8. **Exception Handling**
Mechanisms for handling and managing runtime errors in a structured way. This section covers how to implement robust error handling in C++ programs.

9. **File Operations & Streams**
